# Emotion-Melody-Generator
Project made for Universit√† degli Studi di Salerno's course of Musimathics.

This Python project allows you with the usage of the Genetic Algorithm to casually generate melodies starting from a set of predefined notes and chords.
With an user-friendly GUI you can select an emotion and an instrument and then tapping on "Generate melody" the algorithm will produce a melody based on
what you've selected.

In addiction, is possible to keep track of the used notes by checking the program's txt output and eventually use them as a starting point in real compositions.
